## Programming exercises and examples from Algorithms In C

This is a repository with programming exercises and examples from the book "Algorithms in C" by Robert Sedgewick.

Exercises are under the *exercises* folder.
Examples are under the *Programs* folder.
Some library utilities for trees, queues, and sort methods are under the *Utilities* folder.

Currently trying to do as many programming exercises as possible, if you have one that is missing in this repository feel free to fork and add it.
